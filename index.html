                <p> Cordoba, capital of the homonymous province, located in Argentina: Is a big city of 1.5 million inhabitants, the secondly
                    most populated in this country. Probably, its most significant characteristic is to be the place of the oldest university in the region which
                    has led to the settlement and flow of people from other provinces, and made it develop a shade of cosmopolitanism. Its emplacement is remarkable: it is surrounded by low mountains
                    and plain extensions, which also has helped it acquire its touristic aspect.
