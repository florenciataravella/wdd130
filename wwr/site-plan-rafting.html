        <h2> Overview</h2>
        <h3> Purpose </h3>
        <p> The purpose of the website is to "talk" or communicate with our target audience that is online; provide the basic
            information and optimize time by presenting excursion trip content, photographs, frequently asked questions. But most importantly,
            we aim to have a place to display our services appealing to good marketing techniques.</p> 
        <h3> Audience </h3>
        <p> Who are the target customers? The target audience is aged 25-45. They are mostly economically independent. They enjoy outward entertainment, 
            to hang out with friends and mostly have an active sporty lifestyle. They are capable of affording extra monthly income resources to fulfill these activities.
            What do they want? They want to feel the wellness that outward activities offer while spending time with other people (friends or other excursionists).
            What do they expect to find or what questions will be answered by them accessing the website? They will find information about different
            excursion activities (emplacement, duration, difficoulty level, requisites, discounts and special offers). They will also learn about the complany's 
            experience and historical support which will eventually convince them to hire the excursion. 
            What are their needs that aren't being met? Even though the target audience is familiar with outward activities and sports, it maybe the first time they join
            a rafting excursion. Other customers may have had river trips hiring other companies, however, in either case, the website presents the invaluable opportunity
            to show them the landscape in which our excursions take place, the different services provided, reviews of other customers, audiovisual media that showcases
            the appealing attractions of the excursions and information about our professional team. In all, before entering the page, thay didn't have a complete picture 
            of what are the services offered by the company and its basic information. 
            How will my audience usually access my site (desktop, laptop, mobile device)? They will access it preferably by mobile phone. Since it is a recreational activity, they
            most likely do the search in leisure times in which they are not in their desktop device. </p>
